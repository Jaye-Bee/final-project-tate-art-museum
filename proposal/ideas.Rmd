## Section 1. Introduction

The main motivation of this project was simply to go through art pieces, I like art and talking about it so this motivated me to work.

## Section 2. Data Analysis Plan

These were written before I started:
  - Artists alive from x era to y era
  - Organize by eras
  - Gender
  - Artists w/o a year of death
  - Sort by height/width/depth

## Section 3. Data

My datasets are _artists.csv_ and _artwork.csv_ - explaining the showcased artists of the Tate Art Museum and cataloging the artwork of the museum respectively.
